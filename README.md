# Rspec::Lenny

Welcome to Rspec-lenny ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rspec-lenny'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rspec-lenny

## Usage

Rspec-lenny changes the format of rspec test output. Simply run tests as you would normally, with `bundle exec rspec spec` .
If for whatever reason you can no longer stand the changed output, you can use the format parameter. Example: `bundle exec rspec spec --format progress`

Or remove the gem from your Gemfile.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
